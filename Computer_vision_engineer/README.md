# Computer Vision Nanodegree 

This repository contains project files for Udacity's Computer Vision Nanodegree program which I enrolled on 24 April, 2018.

## Projects

### Facial Keypoint Detection
>[P1_Facial_Keypoints](https://github.com/vmelan/CVND-udacity/tree/master/P1_Facial_Keypoints)

Use image processing techniques and deep learning techniques to detect faces in an image and find facial keypoints, such as the position of the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face.


### Automatic Image Captioning
>[P2_Image_captioning](https://github.com/vmelan/CVND-udacity/tree/master/P2_Image_Captioning)

Combine CNN and RNN knowledge to build a deep learning model that produces captions given an imput image.

### Landmark Detection & Tracking (SLAM)
>[P3_SLAM](https://github.com/vmelan/CVND-udacity/tree/master/P3_SLAM)

Implement Graph SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a 2 dimensional world
